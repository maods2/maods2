## 🧠 About Me

I design and build production-grade Machine Learning systems.

Currently working at Ford Motor Company on large-scale vehicle prognostics, building MLOps platforms that connect Data Engineering and Data Science — from terabyte-scale data ingestion to automated training, deployment, and monitoring.

I’m deeply interested in:

- MLOps & ML Platform Engineering
- Scalable ML systems
- Computer Vision
- Time Series & Prognostics
- LLM systems & agents
- Software architecture for ML

I enjoy working at the intersection of research, engineering, and production reliability.

🔬 Research

MSc in Computer Science (Computer Vision & ML).

Research areas:
- Medical image retrieval (CBIR in digital pathology)
- Representation learning
- Embedding fusion with semantic attributes
- Attention-based architectures

I care about bridging academic ML and real-world systems.
